Late homework will not be accepted.

1. Write a program to do this:

Prompt for a series of game character names and magical power values. Use a dictionary to store the data. The character name is the key, and the magical power is the value. Display the names of the characters with magic over 80. 

Here's a sample run of my solution:

Player name? Hemoglobin the Great Oxygenator
Magic power value? 90
Player name? Mitochondrion the Metabolizer
Magic power value? 75
Player name? 
These characters have magic power values over 80:
Hemoglobin the Great Oxygenator

2. Find the equivalent of Python dictionaries in one or more of these other languages: Perl, C++, Java. Describe it briefly. Hint: this type of data structure is also known as an associative array, hash, or map.
