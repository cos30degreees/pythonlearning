2) Applications of previous topics

DICTIONARIES

Creating a dictionary:
d = dict() or d = {} or d = {'dave': 20, 'eric': 25}

Adding:
d['sam'] = 30

Displaying all the keys:
d.keys()

Displaying all the values:
d.values()

Seeing if a key 'rice' is in a list:
if 'rice' in d:

Problem 1:
Write a word counting program with a dictionary, which prompts for 
words until an empty word is entered. For each word:

If it is not in the dictionary, add an element with the word as
the key, and 1 as the value.
Else increment the value of the element with the word

Finally, display the dictionary, display just the keys, and 
display just the values.

APPLICATIONS OF PREVIOUS TOPICS

Problem 2:
Create one or more programs of your own design, to apply elements
of Pyton that you have learned.
