LISTS

Creating a list:
l = list() or l = [] or l = [1,2,3] or l = ['rice', 'butter']

Seeing if an element is in a list:
if 'rice' in l:

Accessing the elements of a list:

Problem 1:
Write a program with a list, which prompts for words until an 
empty word is entered. For each word:

If it is already in the list, display a message to that effect
Otherwise add it to the list

Finally, display the list.

Problem 2:
Write a program to prompt for a series of numbers and store them
in a list. For each element in the list, prompt the user for a 
number to add to the first. Store the sums in a second list. At
the end display the second list.
