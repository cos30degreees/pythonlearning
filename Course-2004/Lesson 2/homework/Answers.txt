Homework 3 Answers

1. The program has a block of almost identical code which is repeated. It should
be "factored out" and put in a function.

2. 

def getNum():
    num = float(input('Please enter a number: '))
    if num < 0:
        num *= 2
    else:
        num *= 3
    return num

num1 = getNum()
num2 = getNum()

print 'The result is', num1 + num2


3. 

def getSpecialNum():
    while 1:
        try:
            num = float(input('Enter a number > 10: '))
            if num > 10:
                break
            
            print 'That is not > 10'
                
        except (ValueError):
            print 'That is not a number'

    print 'Thank you'

getSpecialNum()

4. You might need to use such functionality from several places in your program.

5. 

class InputCollector:
    def getSpecialNum(self):
        while 1:
            try:
                num = float(input('Enter a number > 10: '))
                if num > 10:
                    break
                
                print 'That is not > 10'
                    
            except (ValueError):
                print 'That is not a number'
    
        print 'Thank you'

inputCollector = InputCollector()
inputCollector.getSpecialNum()
